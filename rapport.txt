**To integrate the supervised learning concepts taught during the course (Lesson 7: Feature Selection) we applied ANOVA F-test to select the most informative features for each asset before training the Random Forest models.
For each ticker, the ANOVA procedure consistently selected MA20, MA60, the daily return, the current price, and 20-day volatility. These features correspond to classical financial predictors related to momentum and short-term risk.

After feature selection, the Random Forest portfolio achieved a total return of 37.35% with a Sharpe ratio of 0.1345, outperforming the Markowitz minimum variance portfolio (35.1%) while remaining less efficient than the Equal-Weight benchmark in this bullish market regime.

Feature selection reduced the dimensionality of the problem without degrading performance, confirming that ANOVA improves model interpretability and robustness while preventing overfitting.”*

“We performed hyperparameter tuning for the Random Forest models using GridSearchCV (Lesson 6 — Hyperparameter optimization). The grid included n_estimators ∈ {100, 200, 500}, max_depth ∈ {None, 5, 10}, and min_samples_split ∈ {2, 5}, with 3-fold cross-validation and accuracy as the scoring function. The selected hyperparameters differed slightly across assets, but typically favored deeper trees and a moderate number of estimators, confirming the trade-off between model complexity and robustness.”

**To comply with the course requirements (Lesson 6 — Hyperparameter Tuning), we performed GridSearchCV to optimize the Random Forest models.
The search space included n_estimators ∈ {100, 200, 500}, max_depth ∈ {None, 5, 10}, and min_samples_split ∈ {2, 5}, with 3-fold cross-validation and accuracy as the evaluation metric.

The optimal hyperparameters varied slightly across assets, with most models favoring a moderate tree depth (max_depth = 5) and 100–200 estimators, while GOOGL benefited from a deeper tree (max_depth=None).
This behavior is consistent with the bias–variance trade-off and confirms the advantage of tree-based ensemble methods in capturing asset-specific nonlinearities.

After hyperparameter tuning, the Random Forest strategy achieved a stable performance of 37.29% total return and a Sharpe ratio of 0.136, outperforming the Markowitz Minimum Variance Portfolio while remaining more conservative than the Equal-Weight benchmark in this bullish market regime.
GridSearchCV therefore validated the robustness of the model and prevented excessive overfitting.”*
